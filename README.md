Coffee Journal
==============

The Coffee Journal is a printable journal for taking notes on manual coffee brewing. 

About two years ago I gave away my automatic drip coffee maker and made the switch to manual brewing for all my coffee. I love my brewers (I mostly use a Hario V60 and a Chemex) but I can get kinda lazy with my technique. To counteract this, I started recording my morning brews in a Field Notes notebook. After going through 3 of these notebooks (and spilling plenty of coffee on each) I decided to draft up a quick, dedicated notebook with designated fields for each data point I recorded.

The original is available as an Illustrator file, and I've made a printable PDF version that can be printed duplex and assembled pretty easily. These are very small so that they don't take up much room in your coffee station. I recommend making a cover out of a case of beer or a cereal box to do it on the cheap, or you can make one out of nicer cardstock if you're fancy.

These files have a MIT license, so go crazy making improvements and making them look better. Lord knows these are quick and dirty and not the prettiest.

These were made specifically for pourover brewing, using the Chemex and V60 as a frame of reference. I assume they would work just as well for a Kalita Wave or any other pourover method, but I haven't brewed with those yet. If I've left out any important fields for other brew methods, please fork and add a version for that or let me know and I will work on it.

Happy Brewing!
